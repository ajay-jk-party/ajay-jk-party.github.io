      <section id="getting-there">
        <h2>Getting There</h2>
        <h3>Best public transport route (train + local stop)</h3>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Train from Frankfurt Hbf to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Take a regional train (DB Regio / RE / RB) from Frankfurt (Main) Hbf directly to Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof.</li>
          <li>These run very frequently (about every 30 minutes or more) and the trip takes around 17 to 20 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Tip: You can use an RMV ticket (for example a single ticket or a Deutschlandticket) for this route if you are in the RMV area.</em></p>
        
        <h3>Step 2: From Darmstadt Hauptbahnhof to Bessungen</h3>
        <p>Once at Darmstadt Hbf, you have a few good local options to reach the Bessungen neighborhood:</p>
        
        <h3>Option A (bus)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Several buses stop near Darmstadt Hbf, including lines like 693, AIR, FM, WE1, etc., connecting from Darmstadt Hbf toward Lincoln Siedlung.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Option B (tram)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>You can also take a tram or light rail from Darmstadt Hbf toward Bessungen (tram lines 3 or 8 are common options in Darmstadt).</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Option C (walk / short taxi)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Lincoln Siedlung is quite walkable from the Hauptbahnhof (about 20-30 minutes on foot depending on your exact destination).</li>
          <li>Or take a short taxi / rideshare if you have luggage or want a direct drop.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Tools that make this easy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>RMV app (RMVgo) for real-time trip planning and ticket purchase (train + bus + tram in one).</li>
          <li>Deutsche Bahn app or website for specific train times.</li>
    </ul>
        
        <h3>Summary travel idea</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Train from Frankfurt Hbf to Darmstadt Hbf (~17-20 min).</li>
          <li>Local bus/tram from Darmstadt Hbf to Lincoln Siedlung (~10-20 min).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This is the simplest and most frequent public transport option.</p>

      <section id="gifts">
        <h2>Gifts and Donations</h2>
        <p>Thank you for thinking about it. Some social trads and cultures make sense and it is justified, however, we both feel that the idea of gifting in events like this is unnecessary, unfortunately, we are more and more getting materialistic. So we request you to not bring any gifts, if you would like to gift, please donate to the following open-source software (that we have heavily abused and continue to do so and procrastinate donating) and/or some of these really cool non-profits. There is some happiness in returning back, so if you would like to gift, please give here!</p>
